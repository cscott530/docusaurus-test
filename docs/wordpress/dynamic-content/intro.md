# Introduction

See the epic in [JIRA](https://emarketer.atlassian.net/browse/CC-339) here for more background information.

The goal of this dynamic content widget is to allow authors in WordPress to define a placeholder where a collection of assets will be dynamically loaded, rather than having to build it out manually with static data within WordPress. As new assets are created that match the widget's criteria, the page will be rebuilt on its own.
